# üìã Test-Fix Task List

These subtasks outline the steps needed to bring all Vitest tests back to passing under the updated round-robin cycling behavior (no hard-coded rate limits).

---

## 1. Align error messages
- [ ] Decide on canonical error text (e.g. ‚Äúexhausted‚Äù vs ‚Äúrate-limited‚Äù).
- [ ] Update unit tests in `tests/keyCycler.test.ts` to expect the chosen text in both exhaustion and manual-failure cases.
- [ ] Update integration tests in `tests/integration/keyCycler.test.ts` to match the same error text.

## 2. Remove in-memory RATE_LIMIT tests
- [ ] In `tests/keyCycler.test.ts`, remove or refactor the ‚Äúrespects rate limits and skips exhausted keys‚Äù test so it verifies pure round-robin cycling without a usage cap.
- [ ] In that same file, remove the 5-iteration exhaustion loop and related assertions that depend on a hard limit of 5 uses per key.

## 3. Simplify markKeyAsFailed tests
- [ ] Update the ‚ÄúmarkKeyAsFailed manually expires a key early‚Äù unit test to:
  - Omit looping 5 times to exhaust keys; instead call `markKeyAsFailed` immediately after one access.
  - Assert that subsequent `getKey` calls always return the remaining key(s) in round-robin order until manually failed.

## 4. Revise integration tests
- [ ] Remove the `const RATE_LIMIT = 5;` import from `tests/integration/keyCycler.test.ts`.
- [ ] For the ‚Äúautomatically cycles through all keys until exhaustion‚Äù test:
  - Change the loop to run exactly `fakeKeys.length` iterations and verify each key is returned once in order.
  - Drop the final `getKey`-throws error assertion (server-driven failures are handled via `markKeyAsFailed`).
- [ ] For the manual-failure flow tests, update error-message expectations and ensure `markKeyAsFailed` is called on the right key after a 429 from the mock server.

## 5. Run and validate
- [ ] Run `npm test` and confirm all unit and integration tests pass.
- [ ] Commit the updated tests and updated `PLAN.md` with message:
      "üî® Complete test-fix PLAN and refactor tests"

## 6. Enhance integration server behavior
- [ ] Extend `mock/fakeApiServer` to accept a custom per-key usage limit (e.g. via test setup or env var).
- [ ] Update integration tests to configure the fake API with a small quota (e.g. 2 calls per key) and assert that after exceeding the quota the server returns 429 on that key.
- [ ] In tests, verify that upon receiving a 429, the cycler calls `markKeyAsFailed` for that key and retries the request with the next key in sequence.

## 7. Plan for exhaustion-reset configuration
- [ ] Define a `resetInterval` option (duration or cron schedule) for each provider when initializing a cycler.
- [ ] Design or extend the cycler factory API to accept `resetInterval` and persist it per provider.
- [ ] Add logic to clear `failed` states (and optionally usage counters) after the configured interval elapses.
- [ ] Write unit tests that simulate time progression to confirm keys re-enter rotation after the reset interval.
- [ ] Update documentation (README and OBJECTIVE.md) to explain exhaustion-reset behavior and how to configure it.
